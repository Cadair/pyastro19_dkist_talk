# DKIST Talk for Python in Astronomy 2019

The DKIST User tools makes heavy use of the Astropy core package as well as
affiliated packages such as gWCS and asdf. In this talk I will give an overview
of the contributions made to these packages to further the DKIST goals as well
as explaining why the DKIST invested time in contributing to these packages,
and the benefits we have gained from utilising them.

These contributions I will cover in this talk include the addition of units to
the astropy.modeling package, adding support for serialising all coordinates
frames to asdf and various contributions to gWCS to add support for units as
well as additional coordinate frames. I hope this talk will provide a good
demonstration of the power of contributing to open source packages.
